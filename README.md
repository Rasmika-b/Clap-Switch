# Clap-Switch
Engineering Clinics Project

- In this contemporary era, humanity continues to achieve remarkable technological feats. It is amazing that we strive for advancement across all domains, ensuring that human endeavors are not squandered. 

- To alleviate the manual effort involved in activating equipments, the innovative "Clap Switch" has been introduced. This device allows for the initiation of various equipment through the simple action of clapping. 

- It is adaptable to an array of electrical devices and can be configured based on individual user preferences. Moreover, the sensitivity of the switch can be finely tuned to align with the user's specific requirements.
